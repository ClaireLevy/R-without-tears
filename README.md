# R without tears 

A course series designed to teach biomedical scientists to use `dplyr` and `ggplot2`, instead of Excel, to analyze their everyday data. It also covers data reshaping, version control with Git/GitHub, and dynamic reports with `rmarkdown` and `knitr`. 

The lessons omit much of what is typical in introductory R courses, such as even basic operations like subsetting with `[]` in favor of `dplyr` idioms which will be more intuitive to scientists with no programming background. Statistical tests are also omitted/delayed. Example datasets include real biomedical data of the sort the audience might generate themselves.
